# Touchable/Touchable Opacity

<Touchable /> is a component that we can import from react-native that we can wrap around any other component.

*Touchable* isn't really a component, it acts more like a parent class. *TouchableOpacity* acts more like a component

*TouchableHighlight* works similar to *TouchableOpacity*, but gives us a bright flash at the background.
