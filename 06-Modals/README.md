# Modals

Allows us to add a full screen overlay over our current screen.

Modal has a property that lets us set whether it is currently visible or not:

```javascript
<Modal visible={false}></Modal>
```

To transition into a modal, we can set an animationType. We have one of three options for an animationType: fade, none, and slide.
